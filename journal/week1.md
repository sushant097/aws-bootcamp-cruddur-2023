Tasks: 
* Create a new GitHub repo
* Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace
* Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. I’m VSCode Extensions
* Clone the frontend and backend repo
* Explore the codebases
* Ensure we can get the apps running locally
* Write a Dockerfile for each app
* Ensure we get the apps running via individual container
* Create a docker-compose file
* Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
* Mount directories so we can make changes while we code
