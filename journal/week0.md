Setting up a billing alarm:
To set up a billing alarm, go to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and click on "Create a billing alarm." Select the metric you want to monitor, set a threshold, and choose the notification method. This will send you an alert when your costs exceed a certain amount.

Overview of AWS and its services:
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services to help businesses scale and grow. Some of the most popular AWS services include:

* EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): This service allows you to create and run virtual machines in the cloud.

* S3 (Simple Storage Service): This service provides scalable object storage for data backup and archiving.
